# SecPickle

We all know that the [Python Pickle module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#module-pickle) is not secure because *arbitrary code* can be executed. The function of `secpickle` is to guarantee that you will only unzip files that were **generated by you**, avoiding reading *unknown files*.
